# MEAN Lab

## Prompt

This is an open-ended group lab! It is up to you and your teammates to come up with a project idea. It must, however, fulfill the following technical requirements...

## Technical Requirements

Your application should be ME(A)N. This includes...
* Using **Express** to handle HTTP requests and serve API endpoints.
* Using **MongoDB** as your database.
* Using **Mongoose** as your ODM.
* Adding **Angular** as your front-end. Express should only handle your root view as well as your API routes. Angular should take care of the rest via `ui.router`.

Your app should have CRUD functionality for at least one model.

Aim to deploy your app to Heroku.

### Bonus I

Add a second model to your application, which is nested under the first.

### Bonus II

Allow the user to log-in using Twitter. [Lesson Plan](https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/express-oauth)

## Getting Started

Before you start coding, spend some time reviewing the [Building a MEAN App lesson](https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/building-a-mean-app)
and make sure to checkout out the walkthrough of how to add Angular to the WhenPresident app.

## Pairs

You will be working in pairs. We will leave the group selection up to you. Feel free find a partner, after the lab has been introduced.

### Some ideas

- A Stack Overflow-style question/answer page
- Recipe / ingredients manager
- Competitive Cookie Clicker
- Image tagger
- A Digital Notebook

## Lab Submission

Please submit an issue to this repo by the time indicated on the course schedule with the following:
* A link to your lab repo.
* A link to your deployed application (if you have one)
* The names of your group members
